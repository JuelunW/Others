// SortedList: This class will be used to store a doubly-linked list in an always-sorted manner,
// such that the user does not specify where in the list a new value should be inserted,
// but rather the new value is inserted in the correct place to maintain a sorted order.
// The interface to the SortedList should be exactly as follows:
class SortedList {
// The SortedList class does not store any data directly.
// Instead, it contains a collection of LinkedNode objects, each of which contains one element.
private :
// Points to the first node in a list, or nullptr if list is empty .
    LinkedNode* m_head;
// Points to the last node in a list, or nullptr if list is empty.
    LinkedNode* m_tail;
public :
// Default Constructor. It will properly initialize a list to be an empty list, to which values can be added.
    SortedList ();
// Copy constructor. It will make a complete(deep) copy of the list, such that one can be changed without affecting the other.
    SortedList (const SortedList& source);
// Copy assignment operator. It will make a complete(deep) copy of the list such that one can be changed without affecting the other.
    SortedList& operator=(const SortedList& rhs);
// Returns the number of nodes contained in the list.
    int getNumElems() const;
// Provides the value stored in the node at the index provided in the 0âˆ’based "index" parameter.
// If the index is out of range, then the function returns a pair with the first element set to false to indicate failure, and the contents of the second element is undefined. Otherwise, the function returns a pair with the first element set to true and the second element will contain a copy of the value at position "index".
    pair<bool, int> getElemAtIndex(int index) const;
// Allows the user to insert a value into the list. Since this is a sorted list, there is no need to specify where in the list to insert the element. It will insert it in the appropriate location based on the value being inserted. If the node value being inserted is found to be "equal to" one or more node values already in the list , the newly inserted node will be placed AFTER the previously inserted nodes.
    void insertValue(int value);

If the list was empty, the function returns a pair with the first element set to false to indicate failure, and the contents of the second element is undefined.
